Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with significant healthcare costs, which can be significantly reduced with early detection. Unfortunately, the wait for an ASD diagnosis tends to be a long process, and the procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism, along with the rise in the number of ASD cases worldwide, highlight the urgent need for the development of simple and effective screening methods. As a result, a time-efficient and easily accessible ASD screening is on the horizon to assist health professionals and inform individuals about whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis.
The rapid increase in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates the creation of datasets pertaining to behavioral traits. However, such datasets are scarce, making thorough analysis to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process difficult. There are currently very few autism datasets associated with clinical or screening purposes, and the majority of them are genetic in nature. As a result, we chose to study a new dataset for autism screening of adolescents that contains 20 features that can be used for further analysis to define key autistic traits and improve ASD case classification.
